NOTES:

threshold: 0.7
epsilon: 0.05

streets gives a comprehensive set -> mostly fractured into single headers
libraries -> demonstrates that it can sort into shared columns 

parks -> nice match on park_name, facility_id (surrey) and Location
  also returns 0.25 score

bikes -> consistently groups headers with very similar headers together

water -> only works for this narrow threshold, otherwise runs out of memory, groups Valves, NodeNo and Types together

threshold: 0.6  
epsilon: 0.1

school -> groups weblinks togehter, as well as all contractors


Surrey DAta: 
Highly organised data
structurally and availability

Vancouver Data:
very informal, differing data types with structural difference between sets (kml)
